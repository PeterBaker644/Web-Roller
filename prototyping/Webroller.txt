Ideas for Webroller:

One side calculator, the other a chat log
Maybe some kind of parchment background?
Some delicate flavor text for the roles perhaps? Some kind of extra text showing the rolls.

Figure out how to make chat rooms, maybe generate a key, or offer the user a chance to generate a key, to allow players to join the room. 
Create a temporary session that is deleted at the end of the session, allow the users to download a file generated from the (json?) files? Maybe this gets filed to the user's account?
